Which states now require a prescription to get a COVID‚Äë19 vaccine at Walgreens or CVS (i.e., where vaccines are no longer available ‚Äúwithout a prescription‚Äù). Based on the most recent information as of early September‚ÄØ2025:


---

CVS

Available without a prescription in 34 states (these include Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, Wyoming) .

Require a prescription from an authorized provider in:

Arizona

Colorado

Florida

Georgia

Kentucky

Louisiana

Maine

North Carolina

New York

Pennsylvania

Utah

Virginia

West Virginia

District of Columbia (D.C.) .


Not offering COVID vaccines at all, even with a prescription, in:

Massachusetts

Nevada

New Mexico .




---

Walgreens

Walgreens states it will comply with each state‚Äôs laws, offering vaccines where permitted .

It has come to light (via reporting by The New York Times) that Walgreens patients would need a prescription in 16 states‚Äîthough not necessarily exactly the same 16 as CVS. The specific list for Walgreens hasn‚Äôt been fully publicly confirmed .



---

Summary Table

Pharmacy	Available w/o Prescription	Prescription Required	Not Offered at All

CVS	34 states (see list above)	AZ, CO, FL, GA, KY, LA, ME, NC, NY, PA, UT, VA, WV, DC	MA, NV, NM
Walgreens	Varies by state; unspecified	16 states (exact list not confirmed)	Possibly the same as CVS



---

Conclusion

If you're looking to find a COVID‚Äë19 vaccine at CVS or Walgreens:

CVS clearly requires a prescription in the 14 states listed above (plus D.C.) and does not offer COVID vaccines at all in Massachusetts, Nevada, and New Mexico.

Walgreens also may require a prescription in up to 16 states, but the exact states differ and have not been fully disclosed publicly.",2025-09-06T13:22:53Z,0

LoaLtfQNX1I,@DotChipsMcGee,"Dr. Potter, I am immensely grateful for you and equally proud of you. I think what is so badly needed in healthcare is more doctors like you. To the colleague who said that to you, I‚Äôd like to posit this:

Sometimes, providing care isn‚Äôt about making as much money as I can and staying safe under the radar. Unfortunately, some in the profession have forgotten that it is (or at least should be) about improving health outcomes for your patient. And yes, Dr. Potter has always demonstrated her compassion and commitment to the very best possible health outcomes for every patient she sees. She shows up time and time again for her patients. This is the best representation that I know of integrity and compassion. Just as she shows up for us, we have and will continue to show up for her and every patient she touches. THIS is what community is about and her advocacy, no doubt, has saved lives and patient dignity. I hope that this isn‚Äôt lost on the profession. Honest, genuine patient care is a mitzvah, a gift that many of us are gladly grateful to share.
