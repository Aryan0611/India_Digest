sMAOLsih4jY,@Kk.r-o2s,"I agree it's a great achievement that we are able to do so much research on the moon with our satellites today..but please understand, the moon plays a very important part in supporting the life on earth. It's because of the lunar cycle and the rays of moon that all plants and vegetation are nourished with the taste and medicinal qualities that they have.
Today we see a lot of people talking about eating specific things for vitamins and minerals and all, but do we even pause and think for a moment, how do these vegetation get these qualities? who infuses these plants with it's medicinal qualities? It's because of the rays of the moon!

It's also clearly mentioned in Srimad Bhagwat Gita, wherein Sri Krishna declares that I am the one who nourishes and provides taste in the form of moon-
गामाविश्य च भूतानि धारयाम्यहमोजसा |
पुष्णामि चौषधी: सर्वा: सोमो भूत्वा रसात्मक: ||15.13

There are many cultures in which food is kept in the moonlight during the night of full-moon and consumed the next day, as the light and rays of the moon are considered to charge the food with great nourishment. 

When the moon as a source of life is this important, we have to be cautious about the potential impact of the satellite technology on the quality and intensity of moonlight and it's impact on the plants for our future generations. Today, mental & emotional stability has gone for a toss, why does this happen? Because in our astrology as well, moon is considered to be the deity of ' मन '
Even science proves that being thousands of kilometres away, the moon is responsible for high tides & low tides on the earth.

By my Sadguru's blessings and Sri Krishnakrupa, I am just sharing my opinion here without any selfish motive, whatever I was able to understand through Srimad Bhagwad Gita and my Sadguru's teachings on it.

And please understand, whatever natural things Paramatma has blessed us with, are at its best when untouched. Why do we have to play games with everything? We as humans are just another form on this planet like any other being, manushya is just an 
' आकार ' (form). We are born, we should do our duty and then leave after sometime. Living in this body is like a rental arrangement. Are we interested or even allowed to do any changes at the place which we have rented? No right! so it's better that we just live here, enjoy the beautiful creation of this nature, fulfill our duties for which we are born and leave! Remember, only the ones who 'live' peacefully, 'leave' peacefully.

So imagine the salary of a normal scientist. When a indian has to become a scientist they also go and work in foreign countries. We all know that in NASA majority are indians and we all know why !! . When will scientist get recognition in this country?? There was a time when a scientist of india worked on Einstein's relativity theory before einstine !! What now !! There was a time when a scientist used to be the president of india !!now we have a chai wala as prime minister 🥴🥴. They're was a time when scientist was the celebrity in the eyes of people!! What now !! . Chandrayaan 3 succeed so we appreciate them . But even by chance it was failed we and govt would've been the first one to criticize ISRO before anyone else!!
